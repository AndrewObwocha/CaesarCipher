# Substitution Cipher Password Manager CLI

## Overview

This project consists of two Python command-line scripts (`encrypt.py` and `decrypt.py`) that allow a user to "store" website and password pairs using a simple, custom substitution cipher (similar in concept to a Caesar cipher but using a specific character set).

**`encrypt.py`**: Prompts the user for a numerical shift key, then repeatedly asks for website names and passwords. It validates password strength (length, character types), encrypts the website and password using the shift key and a predefined character set, and appends them to a file named `saved_passwords.txt`. The shift key itself is stored as the first line in this file.

**`decrypt.py`**: Reads the specified file (e.g., `saved_passwords.txt`), extracts the shift key, decrypts all the stored website-password pairs, and allows the user to look up the decrypted password for a given website.

## Features

*   **Encryption (`encrypt.py`):**
    *   Takes a numerical shift key from the user.
    *   Prompts for website and password input iteratively.
    *   Includes basic password validation (minimum length, character types: upper, lower, digit, specific special chars).
    *   Encrypts website (lowercase) and password using a custom substitution cipher based on the shift key.
    *   Stores the shift key and encrypted pairs in `saved_passwords.txt`.
*   **Decryption (`decrypt.py`):**
    *   Reads the specified file containing the key and encrypted data.
    *   Decrypts all stored website-password pairs.
    *   Allows the user to query for a specific website and retrieve its decrypted password.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Simple interactive prompts for user input.

## How it Works

The "encryption" uses a fixed string `encryption_source` as its alphabet.
`encryption_source = r"7elL2GJVkrv0dQ%Eb?N6uw*#t!@hYAop&O^a3FWCyKUT4PR5zBjDH8XgZnf9qMm1cSIsi$x "`

*   **Encryption:** For each character in the input data, its index in `encryption_source` is found. The character at `(index - shift_key) % length_of_source` in `encryption_source` becomes the encrypted character.
*   **Decryption:** For each character in the encrypted data, its index is found. The character at `(index + shift_key) % length_of_source` becomes the decrypted character.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x

## Usage

1.  **Ensure files are together:** Place `encrypt.py` and `decrypt.py` in the same directory.
2.  **Run Encryption (`encrypt.py`):**
    ```bash
    python encrypt.py
    # or python3 encrypt.py
    ```
    *   Enter a numerical shift key when prompted.
    *   Follow the prompts to enter website names and passwords.
    *   Password validation rules will be enforced.
    *   Data will be saved to `saved_passwords.txt`.
3.  **Run Decryption (`decrypt.py`):**
    ```bash
    python decrypt.py
    # or python3 decrypt.py
    ```
    *   Enter the filename containing the data (e.g., `saved_passwords.txt`).
    *   Enter the website name you want to look up the password for.
    *   The script will output the decrypted password if the website is found.

## File Structure

*   `encrypt.py`: Script for encrypting and saving website/password pairs.
*   `decrypt.py`: Script for reading the file, decrypting, and looking up passwords.
*   `saved_passwords.txt` (Generated by `encrypt.py`): Stores the shift key and encrypted data. **Warning: Insecure.**
